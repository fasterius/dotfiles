# Bash settings

[![License: MIT][1]][2] 

These are my (fairly minimalistic) Bash settings, contained in the
`bash_profile` and `bashrc` files. If you want to use these, simply copy or
symlink them to your home folder and rename them to `.bash_profile` and
`.bashrc`. The latter simply sources the former.

There is also a Bash script (`hide_home_folder.sh`) that hides the default OSX
home folders (i.e. "Desktop", "Downloads", etc.) from Finder and creates
symbolic links in a new `~/home` folder for easy access without cluttering up
the default `~` home folder. Simply execute it if you want to use this
solution.

The `gitignore_global` file contains git ignore statements that will be used on
a global (system-wide) scale.
